            Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of past events and societies.[16] Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. 
            In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was reputed to date from as early as 722 BC, though only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.

A highly decorated entrepreneur and tech influencer, Khoury’s journey, steeped in data-driven innovation, began as a geneticist whose research and findings led to early contributions to the Human Genome Project. Merging a love for the sciences with a fascination with software, he then built his first company, Symptomcare.com, which set out to democratize healthcare for all, and doing so while attending law school and business school at Northwestern School of Law and Kellogg School of Management. After exiting the business, Khoury transitioned to a career as a high-tech Silicon Valley M&A attorney and later managed two successful Venture Capital funds where he invested in cutting edge technologies spanning numerous industries including water reclamation, vertical farming, pharmaceuticals, genetic sequencing, digital marketing and digitized healthcare. Taking a strong interest in the complexities of the marketing technology landscape, he went on to navigate two companies through three marketing revolutions: social, mobile, and now AI. As the CEO of SOCi, Khoury is passionate about changing the relationship people have with software, from a tool that we use, to a partner that we can train to do work for us and free us up to do what we love. Under Khoury’s leadership, SOCi has become the #5 marketing platform globally according to G2, and the leading marketing platform for multi-location enterprises. SOCi has been one of the Inc. 5000 Fastest Growing Companies in America for the last six years, and its marketing technology serves as the backbone to nearly 1,000 global brands (including Ford, Ace Hardware, Kumon, and Jersey Mike’s) who are managing more than 3 million locations on the platform. SOCi is now building the world’s first CoMarketing Cloud—an autonomous marketing and data analytics platform that leverages A.I. and SOCi’s proprietary technology to “do the marketing for you”. Beyond his professional achievements, Khoury is a passionate data enthusiast, seasoned investor, trusted advisor, husband, father (four boys), and perpetual student. These multifaceted roles have defined his journey, fueling a pragmatic approach to innovation, a penchant for pushing boundaries, and an enduring humility for ingenuity.
